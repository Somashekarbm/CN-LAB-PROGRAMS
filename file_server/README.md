# Simple File Server
This is a simple file server written using the Python socket module. The purpose of this is to understand the networking primitives

## How to use
- Run `server.py`, then `client.py` in another terminal window (the order is important) using either the `python`/`py` (on Windows) or `python3` (on Linux) command.
- Enter the name of the file to send in the client window (the file should exist in the server directory).
- A copy of the file should now be in the client directory and the programs should exit.
